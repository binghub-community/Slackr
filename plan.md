-------------------27th October DEADLINE!!!!!!---------------




As of now, we have separated the functions into 4 logical buckets: authentication functions, 
user functions, channel functions and message functions. These correspond
to the various user stories we have developed and are also summarized below. 

We need to authenticate the user first before building the channels. 
Start with the auth functions, then lead into the user functions in order to complete each users’ profiles.

Then we will go on to build channels where users can join and leave, view the members of each channel and invite people.

Then the message functions come next, the users may leave messages, view messages, edit and react to them. 

The search function will then be implemented, allowing users to search for a string 
with which slackr will attempt to match with an existing message.

Finally, we will develop the standup functions, 15-minute period where users 
send messages and then have them summarized by the end. 

We are expecting this function to be the most challenging out of all the functions, 
hence we gave ourselves a lot more time for a single function compared to the rest. 
Given 3 weeks between our iteration 1 and iteration 2, we plan to finalise all 4 buckets within 2 and a half weeks, 
giving us a 3-4 day leeway for any final adjustments.

With our tests completed, implementing most of the functions do not seem too difficult, 
however we are also expecting to spend many grueling nights perfecting all the functions.
