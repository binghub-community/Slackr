Reflection

As software developers, agile programming practices are a fundamental part of working cohesively as a team in any teamwork based environment. 

We established a facebook group chat as our main channel of communication as it was convenient and everybody was familiar with how to use it. If anyone had any questions about any part of the assignment or required help, it would be voiced in the group chat. Our secondary channel of communication was through the use of Discord app. This was advantageous in the sense that group members were able to communicate more effectively through screen-share and voice calls rather than sending text messages which may not encompass the entirety of a proposed problem or question and provided a more comprehensive opportunity to 'work together' without physically meeting up due to extracurricular committments of each group member. 

As we struggled to find a time where all members of the group were available to physically meet up, we decided it would be more accommodating for everyone to hold meetings on Discord. As Iteration 3 was more about the refined implementation and integration of our code with the front end, our meetings became more centred around debugging existing or new issues rather than producing new functional algorithms.

During each meeting, we broke it up into 3 key stages:

1. Progress Check and Debugging
    
    Each person would present and summarise what work that they have done since the last meeting in regards to an agreed goal (e.g Finish writing pytests or refactoring our AUTH/MESSAGE/USER/CHANNEL functions). If the group member had not finished or cannot, due to unforeseen circumstances, other members of the group would help shoulder the responsibility and divide the workload to add upon for the next meeting or address any issues the group member had with the tasks. Our progress was measured on the GitLab Taskboard where any issue that arised would be added to the task board. Each member would complete assign themselves to issues on the task board until all issues were completed.

2. Minutes and Agendas for next meeting

    We would briefly summarise the meeting and use that as a basis, in addition to the plan, to determine the agendas for next meeting. This included how were were to divide out the workload and which areas we wanted to work on. (E.g We concluded in our first meeting that our tests were inadequate towards producing a respectable, working product)

3. Work on some code together

    At this point the meeting is informally adjourned and we used this opportunity to socialize while working on our delegated parts of the assignment together. Everyone was free to leave if they had other things to attend to but this stage was initially more leisure as we ended up playing TeamFight Tactics but towards the due date of the assignment it was much more work oriented.


For Iteration Three, we discovered that our pytests were insufficient in testing our functions so we had to focus on improving and devising better tests for our work so that the refactoring and integration process could be completed. After realising this, instead of assigning each member to do one refactoring function file, the prime priority was to ensure our pytests were working. We held an urgent meeting and as a team spent extra time ensuring the pytests worked by Thursday to allow time to refactor and test the frontend.

A lot of time was spent on testing which in retrospect, should have been more thorougnly completed in Iteration 2 to prevent this exact issue in the following iteration which we suffered for due to time constraints. Compared to the previous iteration, our use of agile practices were much more refined as we made a much more conscientious attempt towards working with branches after a particular incident where almost our entire test file was a merge conflict. As a whole, this entire project has been very mentally stimulating and challenging for our group. Starting from being disadvantaged due to half our group going to Nationals, then having to catch up and trying to account for our absences, it was a relatively fun albeit stressful term.

For iteration 3, we continued to meet up once a week to talk about the assignment. It was difficult finding a time to accomodate everyone. We however would hold discord meetings and after program on different features while in the discord allowing us to communicate openly any concerns, debug errors and help each other while programming. When we had multiple people working on the same file, code, we notified the group in the discord that we were pushing and identified which files we worked on to avoid merge conflicts. We also added comments above the modified code so that the next person would easily understand what was accomplished in the commit.
