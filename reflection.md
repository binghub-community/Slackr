During our first meeting as a team that occurred during our Wednesday lab, 
we decided to create a messenger group on Facebook, 
to communicate and discuss issues that may arise if a team member is confused about a component. 
Should two members disagree on a decision, we decided we would discuss this in a group chat 
and give each member a chance to demonstrate their point of view. 
Each member of the team discussed the requirements of the assignment, 
assigning the components between the team and working through each criteria.

In the meeting we decided that:

- Marvin and James would research on writing draft pytests for the project
- Kath-Lin and Harry would brainstorm potential user stories for the project

After this first iteration, as a team we believe there are many areas of improvement. 
To begin with, even though deadlines were given to each member of the team, 
tasks were not completed by the deadline due to two members participating in 
the Division 1 University Nationals for the week.
As a result, many tasks were rushed and not completed to their best potential.
This made it difficult for the 2 other available members to temporarily take on the tasks of the other two absent members. 
To improve on the next iteration, the team should create rough deadlines and strict deadlines
so that each member can strive to finishing by the rough deadline and will be less penalizing. 
Furthermore, absent members should also notify the team that they will be away more than 1 week in advance 
because even though the team was notified early, 
it was not early enough given the assignment specifications were published later.

Furthermore, other areas of improvement included a thorough thought-out methodology for completing this iteration. 
Even though components were assigned to each member, the methodology and assumptions were not clear 
and had to be discussed later which could have been more effectively if these were discussed earlier. 

Communication within the team can also be improved by having an allocated meeting time to discuss updates and tasks 
completed for this project. Having an allocated meeting time will also allow a collaborative time to discuss any worries as well 
as a time to update other team mates on their progress.

Marvin worked on writing a significant amount of the pytests and helped James and Kath-Lin to also work on the Pytests.

Kath-Lin worked on summarizing the brainstormed user storied and published the finished user stories on the gitlab board. 
She also listed assumptions made and worked on pytesting

Harry worked on writing and finalising the planning markdown file, edited the general reflection and teamwork performance and also worked on pytesting.

James worked on the pytesting with Marvin.
